/**
 * Exercise Recognition Library
 * 
 * The Exercise Recognition Library is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the recognition and analysis of various exercises performed by
 * individuals. This library integrates an algorithm to accurately identify and classify a wide range of physical movments commonly encountered in
 * fitness, rehabilitation, sports training, and wellness applications.
 * 
 * An exercise has two parts, the upper and lower part. On the other hand, the human body has also two parts, right and left parts. Consequently,
 * the algorithm works calculating the distances between two articulations, the angle between two lines or both for each part of the exercise for
 * each part of human body. This way, if the exercise is executed correctly, the requirements of the distances and angles will be satisfied and the
 * repetition will be valid.
